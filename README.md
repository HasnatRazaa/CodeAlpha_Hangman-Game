# ---- Hangman Game ----

A simple implementation of the classic Hangman game in Python. Players try to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters one at a time.

## Features
  - Randomly selects a word from a predefined list
  - Displays a visual representation of the hangman
  - Keeps track of incorrect guesses and guessed letters
  - Allows the player to play multiple rounds

## How to Play
  1. Run the script.
  2. The game will randomly select a word, and you will see a series of underscores representing each letter of the word.
  3. Guess a letter by typing it and pressing enter.
  4. If the letter is in the word, the corresponding underscores will be replaced with the guessed letter.
  5. If the letter is not in the word, the hangman diagram will progress.
  6. Continue guessing letters until you either guess the word correctly or run out of guesses.
  7. After the game ends, you will be prompted to play again or quit.
